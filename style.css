/*  Position properties */

/*  no css program without position properties atleast 1 is used */

/* If we want to position our HTML data in anywhere on the website. */

/* 5 types */

/* 1. Static (useless) */
/* 2.Relative --> The movemnt of top , left , right , and bottom will always happens from its original position */
/* 3.Absolute --> The movemnt of top , left , right , and bottom will always happens from its webpage or browser*/
/* 4.Fixed */
/* 5.Sticky */

/*  Whenever we use any of the position properties, we can control left, right , top and bottom*/

/* If we use only absolute position without relative position, that absolute will have
left, right, top and bottom which always work from webpage. */
/* If we use absolute(child) and relative( parent, grandparent,.. ) position together,
that absolute will have left, right, top and bottom will always work from 
parent which is made relative */
